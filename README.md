# Conway-s-Game-of-life
Conway's Game of life also known simply as Life, is a zero-player game is a cellular automaton dvised by John Horton Conway in 1970. 


The universe of Life is a infinite, 2d orthogonal grid of square cells. Where each cell has only 2 possible states, live or dead (populated or unpopulated). Every cell can interact with its 8 neighbouring cells in horizontal, vetical or diagonal. Each step in time the following will happen:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
